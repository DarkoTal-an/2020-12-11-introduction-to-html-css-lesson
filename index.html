    <!-- CSS: Cascading Style Sheet
      Let's use an external css file. Another option, less common, but acceptable if you
      have a single page website, is to put your css inside the style tags <style></style>
      inside the <head> of your HTML
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>

  <!-- Here starts the actual page, what we will see on the browser -->
  <body>
    <!-- We have 6 heading tags, from <h1> to <h6> 
      They are used to add titles to the whole page or to individual sections.
      The numbers establish a hierarchy of importance, with <h1> being the most important to <h6>,
        the least important.
      If we don't change their appearance through CSS, the browser will apply some default styles,
      making them to appear bigger or smaller. But avoid mixing the size with the importance. To a search engine, <h1> will always be more important.
      IMPORTANT: use only one <h1> tag in your page.

        -> read carefully the section on accessibility concerns

      <!-- Create lists using <ul> and <ol>, for unordered and ordered lists. 
        Inside, create individual list items with the <li> tag.

          If we add links to a list, we can have a simple navigation for our website.

    <!-- <div> elements are useful to wrap other HTML elements to style them differently, or
      simply to change the structure of your HTML page -->
    <!-- never use inline CSS like I'm doing here, it's just for the example -->

    <div style="background: green; color: white; padding: 16px; width: 500px;">
      <h3>Another recipe:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>peel potatoes</li>
        <li>slice potatoes</li>
        <li>fry</li>
        <li>eat</li>

    <!-- HTML elements can have attributes, which let us add or change some properties.
      Not every element has the same attributes.
      For example, links, the <a> element, have the special href attribute which we use to
        link to another resource, a URL or another HTML page.

      Each element can have the id and class attributes. We can use those to then change the style
      of the element through CSS.

      Except for the exercises we do in class, it's best to avoid relying on id for styling.

      An element can have as many class as you want, just separate them with a space:
      class="class1 class2 class3"

      On the other hand, elements can have only one id, and each id must be UNIQUE inside the page. Meaning, you can't use the same id twice. Neither three or four times etc.
    -->

    <div class="recipe">
      <h3>Same recipe, with more class:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>peel potatoes</li>
        <li>slice potatoes</li>
        <li>fry</li>
        <li>eat</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- <span> elements are similar to <div>, but they work inline, for example to mark 
      individual words inside of a <p>, a paragraph 
        -->
    <p>This paragraph has a <span class="important">span</span> inside of it</p>

    <!-- You can always go to a new line using the <br> element. -->
    <p>What a nice paragraph.<br>
      On a new line.
    </p>

    <!-- Some elements are a bit different than others, and don't have a closing tag.
      Images are one of those elements. The content of an image, the image itself, is specified
      with the src attribute.
      In the src attribute you can put a url of an image, or a path to an image on your computer. 

      Images have other two important attributes, the alt text and the title:
      alt: it appears if the image couldn't be loaded for any reason. It should be used as an alternative to the image itself, possibly describing its content.
      title: it's the title of the image, and it appears if you hover with your mouse on the picture

    <!-- We have a few HTML elements called semantic elements. You can read more about them here, in the
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics

      You can skip the sections about JavaScript and CSS, for now.
    -->

    <!-- Semantic elements give meaning to our content. For example, to a search engine, a date inside 
        a div doesn't mean anything. It's just a series of characters, but it can be anything:
        - a mathematical operation
        - a weird telephone number
        - the name of a Star Wars character

        Using the proper HTML element we can specify that it's a date
